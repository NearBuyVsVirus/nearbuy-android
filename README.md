# Nexd Android App

![Android CI](https://github.com/NexdApp/nexd-android/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Build

In order to build the application following Gradle command can be used:

```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

You can also simply use Android Studio to build, debug and test the project.


## Api client

Api client is being generated by using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) and the [OpenAPI Generator Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-gradle-plugin) and **should not be modified by hand**. The configuration is included in the root [build.gradle](https://github.com/NexdApp/nexd-android/blob/develop/build.gradle) file.

Swagger Api documentaion used for generation is available [here](https://nexd-backend-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v1/docs/).

Use following command to trigger a new generation (if e.g. api has changed):

```
./gradlew generateApiClient
```
